What is Sentiment Analysis?
Sentiment analysis is a kind of data mining where you measure the inclination of people’s opinions by using NLP (natural language processing), text analysis, and computational linguistics. We perform sentiment analysis mostly on public reviews, social media platforms, and similar sites. Following are the main types of sentiment analysis:

Fine-grained
Fine-grained sentiment analysis gives precise results to what the public opinion is about the subject. It classified its results in different categories such as: Very Negative, Negative, Neutral, Positive, Very Positive. 

Detecting Emotion
This kind of sentiment analysis identifies emotions such as anger, happiness, sadness, and others. Many times, you’ll use lexicons to recognize emotions. However, lexicons have drawbacks too, and in those cases, you’d need to use ML algorithms. 

Based on Aspect
In aspect-based sentiment analysis, you look at the aspect of the thing people are talking about. Suppose you have reviews of a smartphone, you might want to see what the people are talking about its battery life or its screen size. 

Multilingual
Sometimes organizations need to analyze the text of different languages. This form of sentiment analysis is considerably challenging and requires a lot of effort because you’d need many resources. 

Sentiment analysis has many applications in various industries. As it helps in understanding public opinion, companies use sentiment analysis in doing market research and figuring out if their customers like a particular product (or service) or not. Then, according to the findings of the sentiment analysis, the organization can modify the respective product or service and achieve better results. 

All in all, it helps companies in understanding their customers better. Companies can serve their customers better when they know where they lag and where they excel.
